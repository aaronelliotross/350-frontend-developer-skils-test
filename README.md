# 350.org Frontend Developer Skills Test

Welcome to the Responsive Web Page project! This take-home project is designed to evaluate your frontend development skills. Please follow the instructions below to complete the project.

## Project Description
### Objective
Using the `React App` that has been boostrapped for you, create a responsive web page that displays information about a fictional event. The page should adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

### Requirements
- Include a header section with a `title`, `navigation links`, and a `timezone selector` - *use a dropdown for this*.
- Create a main content area with details about the event, such as `date`, `time` (**try to display the time of the event in the selected timezone**), `location`, and `a brief description`.
- Create a `Speakersâ€™ Section` with `fictional names`, `designations` (e.g., Software Engineer), and `pictures` (use [this API](https://xsgames.co/randomusers/) to generate speakers' pictures for the event).
- Implement responsiveness so that the page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. Use media queries and flexible layouts (e.g., flexbox or grid) to achieve this.
- Add a registration form at the bottom of the page with fields for name, email, and a submit button. The form should have basic validation for the email field.
- Style the page using CSS to make it visually appealing. You can use CSS frameworks like `Bootstrap` or `Tailwind` if you prefer.
- Optionally, you can add any additional features or enhancements that showcase your frontend development skills like `tests`.
